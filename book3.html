            <p class="description">I always asked mom about my father but she always told me, ‘Your father came for a night to ruin my whole life.' A Story about Dreams, Hope and Death. Oh, I am sorry. I’m extremely sorry; I usually forget to introduce myself. I’m Amanda, a plain sailing girl who loves to explore love and life in an adventurous way. Everyone has a story for being a different personality and I have also. I was born poor to raise my old mother instead of she raised me. I am glad that my old mother gave me my first home for nine months. Happiness is hard for our family and sometimes even the hardest. I know when babies born, they cry but when I was born, I and my mom both were crying because I had entered the world where cruelty is always the first choice. I had never seen my father so I was never called to be daddy’s princess but a normal girl who has no right to see her dreams, not even when I am sleeping.</p>
