            <p class="description">
                Sometimes, you do not write your story, it writes you. You don't choose your story, it chooses you. But would you believe it if someone told you, 'This is Not Your Story'? Would you have the courage to rewrite it? Shaurya, a CA student. This is his story of following his dreams. Miraya, an interior designer. This is her story of believing in love. Anubhav, an aspiring entrepreneur. This is his story of giving life another chance. After her record-breaking debut novel Everyone Has A Story, Savi Sharma tells a transforming tale of courage, hope and self-discovery.</p>
